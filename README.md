Hello!
Despite my honorable age, I'm new to the Git. I can handle (or write) relatively simple code, but there are hardly any secrets in HW that I don't know.
And since the modern HW almost always requires a firmware, that's why I'm here.
I will try to share here all my findings researching this or that.
Cheers!
